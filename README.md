# Dodge Asteroids
A pixelated 2D space shooter I made for a high school project (10th grade), in about two weeks. This is the first game I ever made (and finished), so the code isn't perfect. You can play it [here](https://luca1152.itch.io/dodge-asteroids).

## Getting started

Windows: `gradlew desktop:run`  
Linux: `./gradlew desktop:run`
